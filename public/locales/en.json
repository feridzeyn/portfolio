  "aboutMe": "I am Farid Zeynalzade, a graduate of the Azerbaijan Technical University. I currently live in Prague and I have a permanent residence permit. Since June 2024, I have been developing my skills in the field of frontend development. My mentor <1>Elgun Mammadli</1> played a key role in providing me with fundamental knowledge and direction on this path. I did not limit my learning to the course; I also continuously expanded my knowledge through self-study. I completed my internship at \"MyMentor Internship and Development Agency,\" where I participated in several small and one large team project. These experiences provided me with valuable insights into the real work environment, teamwork, and project management. I am currently deepening my knowledge of frontend technologies and continue learning to build user-oriented and functional web interfaces.",
